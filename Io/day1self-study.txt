Day 1 Self-Study
When you’re looking for Io background, searching for answers is going
to be a little tougher because Io has so many different meanings. I
recommend Googling for Io language.
Find:
- Some Io example problems
    https://gist.github.com/jezen/7972975
    Fibonacci at n (see fib.io)
- An Io community that will answer questions
    #Io on freenode IRC
- A style guide with Io idioms
    http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Io_Programming/Io_Style_Guide
Answer:
- Evaluate 1 + 1 and then 1 + "one". Is Io strongly typed or weakly
typed? Support your answer with code.
    1 + 1 - 2 and 1 + "one" throws an exception because Number and Sequence
    are incompatible. However, you can append them to a Sequence using ..
    operator.
    1 + 1
    ==> 2
    1 + "one"
    Exception:
    1 .. "one"
    ==> 1one
- Is 0 true or false? What about the empty string? Is nil true or false?
Support your answer with code.
    0 is 0, true is true, false is false, the empty string is the empty
    string and nil is nil. None of them are equal to each other, they are
    all separate objects that can be cloned. They are also all singletons, as
    well as all string literals are singletons.
- How can you tell what slots a prototype supports?
    {Object} slotNames
- What is the difference between = (equals), := (colon equals), and ::=
(colon colon equals)? When would you use each one?
    All three are assignement operators
    equals changes the value of an existing object
    colon equals creates or changes the value of an object
    colon colon equals creates orchanges the value of an object
    and also creates a setter for that value
    operator	action
    ::=         Creates slot, creates setter, assigns value
    :=          Creates slot, assigns value
    =           Assigns value to slot if it exists, otherwise raises exception
    You would use = to change a value that already exists. You would use := to create
    a new object and assign its value. You would use ::= to create a new slot and
    its setter when designing a class.

Do:
- Run an Io program from a file.
    io fib.io
- Execute the code in a slot given its name.
    see fib.io
    also:
    Object slotNames
    ==> list(...,asBoolean,...)
    Object asBoolean
